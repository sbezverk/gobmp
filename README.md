goBMP is an implementation of Open BMP (RFC 7854) protocol’s collector in go language.  Collected BGP information can be published to kafka topics, stored in the file in JSON format or printed to stdout.

 

goBMP is suitable to run as a standalone binary as well as a containerized workload, provided deployment yaml allows running it as a deployment in Kubernetes.

 

goBMP receives BGP updates as a part of Open BMP messages, goBMP parses them and generates records depending on BGP Update NLRI and AFI/SAFI.

goBMP also supports a number of drafts for under development protocols and extensions, such as BGP LS extensions for SRv6 support, Flex Algo, Application Specific attributes etc.

RFC 9723 (BGP Colored Prefix Routing for SRv6) is supported via Color Extended Community extraction in IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast prefixes, enabling intent-aware routing for SRv6 deployments.

RFC 8097 (BGP Prefix Origin Validation State) is supported via Origin Validation State Extended Community extraction in IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast and L3VPN prefixes, enabling RPKI validation state propagation within autonomous systems.

RFC 7311 (AIGP - Accumulated IGP Metric) is supported via BGP Path Attribute 26, enabling IGP metric propagation across AS boundaries for traffic engineering in large service provider networks.

RFC 5701 (IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community) is supported for IPv6 VPN deployments, enabling IPv6-based route targets and route origin extended communities.

For the complete list of supported extensions and drafts follow this link: [Support RFCs and Drafts.](https://github.com/sbezverk/gobmp/blob/master/BMP.md)

 

 

The structure of the each record which is published to kafka, nats, stored in the message file or printed to standard output, is defined in the package **_message_** [file types.go](https://github.com/sbezverk/gobmp/blob/master/pkg/message/types.go)

## Building goBMP

```
git clone https://github.com/sbezverk/gobmp

cd   gobmp

make gobmp
```


The statically linked linux binary will be stored in ./bin sub folder.

## Running goBMP

### As a binary

```
./bin/gobmp {list of parameters}
```

*goBMP parameters:*

```
--destination-port={port} (default 5050)
```

When goBMP works in an intercept mode, it receives incoming BMP messages on the source port, makes a copy of BMP message and then transmits the message to the processing listening on a destination port.


```
--dump={file|console}
```

Dump processed BMP messages into a file or to the standard output.


```
--intercept={true|false}
```

When intercept set "true", all incomming BMP messages will be processed and a copy of a message  will be sent to TCP port specified by destination-port.


```
--kafka-server=”kafka server:port”
```

Kafka server TCP/IP address


```
--msg-file={message file path and location} (default "/tmp/messages.json")
```

Full path and  file name to store messages when "dump=file"  


```
--source-port={source-port} (default 5000)
```

Port to listen for incoming BMP messages (default 5000)


```
--v=(1-7)
```

Log level, please use --v=6 for debugging. Level 6 prints in hexadecimal format the incoming message. 

### As a kubernetes deployment

**goBMP** can be ran as a kubernetes workload. The deployment yaml file is located in *./deployment* folder. **goBMP** deployment exposes 2 ports,
first port (by default 5000) is used for incoming BMP sessions, second port (56767) is used for performance monitoring, **goBMP** exposes standard golang 
**pprof** endpoints.

```
kubectl create -f ./deployment/gobmp-standalone.yaml
```

To check the status of a deployment and services

```
kubectl get pod
```

Expected output for gobmp pod

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
gobmp-765db4dcd9-6nh2c              1/1     Running   0          12h

```

```
kubectl get svc 
```

Expected output for gobmp service

```
NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                 PORT(S)                      AGE
gobmp              ClusterIP   10.224.249.86    192.168.80.254              5000/TCP,56767/TCP           17h

```

In order to establish BMP session between an external BMP speaker and **goBMP** application running in kubernetes, goBMP's port must be exposed externally, as in the case of the output provided above, where 192.168.80.254 is external address. The external BMP speaker will need to use **192.168.80.254:5000** to reach goBMP application.

### As a Docker container

#### Quick start with RIS Live feed from RIPE

Start gobmp daemon :

```
sudo docker run --net=host sbezverk/gobmp --dump=console
```

Start bgp live feed from RIPE (converted to BMP) :

```
sudo docker run --net=host sbezverk/ris2bmp:1
```

Sample output :

```

```

## Status

**goBMP** is work in progress, even though a considerable number of AFI/SAFI and BGP-LS attributes are processed, there is still a lot of work for contribution.
See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sbezverk/gobmp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for latest updates to this project.
